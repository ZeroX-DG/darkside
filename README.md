_A TUI-kit written in Rust for rust app_

## Why?

I fell in love with TUI-app since I started to use i3wm since they are extremely fast and get the work done. This is an attempt to bring that powerful feature of TUI app combined with Rust. I used [`ncurses-rs`](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs) as a backend for this crate because I'm of the simple, elegant API design of ncurses.
