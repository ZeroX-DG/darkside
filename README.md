*A TUI-kit written in Rust for rust app*

## Why?

Well, I'm just getting started with Rust so I pretty bad at handling Rust-related things such as lifetime or borrowing, so instead of using other TUI library which used struct and other complicated things, I used [`ncurses-rs`](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs) and I f*cking love it because it's so simple. That's why I tried to make a TUI-kit but keep the same simple API structure and this is the result.
